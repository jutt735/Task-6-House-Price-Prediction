# House Price Prediction

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict house prices using different property features such as number of rooms, crime rate, and area details.

## Dataset
- Boston Housing Dataset
- Source: Public GitHub dataset

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Selected features and target variable
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Trained a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated the model using MAE and RMSE
6. Visualized actual vs predicted prices

## Model Used
- Linear Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Results
The model was able to predict house prices with reasonable accuracy. The scatter plot shows a clear relationship between actual and predicted prices.

## Conclusion
This project helped in understanding regression models and how machine learning can be used in real estate price prediction.
